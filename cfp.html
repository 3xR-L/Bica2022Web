            <p class="text-justify">BICA Society is a nonprofit international organization founded in 2010 with the purpose to promote and facilitate the transdisciplinary study of Brain-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA), aiming at the emergence of a unifying, generally accepted framework for the design, characterization and implementation of human-level artificial intelligence. Cognitive Architectures are general-purpose computational architectures inspired by scientific theories developed to explain cognition in animals and men. Cognitive Architectures have been employed in many different kinds of applications, since the control of robots to decision-making processes in intelligent agents. In many cases, a cognitive architecture is decomposed based on the cognitive capabilities they are able to provide, like perception, attention, memory, reasoning, learning, behavior generation, etc. Cognitive Architectures are, at the same time, theoretical modelings for how many different cognitive processes interact to each other in order to sense, reason and act, and also software frameworks which can be reused through different applications. The field of research on Cognitive Architectures has now a history of more than 40 years of research. A comparative table, presenting a comprehensive review of the most important implemented CAs in the literature is available at the BICA Society web site.The "BICA Challenge" was proposed originally in 2012 by BICA Society, as the challenge to create a general-purpose, real-life computational equivalent of the human mind using an approach based on cognitive architectures. It differentiates to other methodologies on Artificial Intelligence by its explicit inspiration on cognitive neuroscience and neuro-psychology.
